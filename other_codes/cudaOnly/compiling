To compile de multi-GPU code:

nvcc -Xcompiler -fopenmp -O3 -DIMPROVED multiGPUQueens.cu 

Where the -DIMPROVED is to avoid mirrored solutions, i.e., makes the search almost 2x faster.

To execute: ./a.out size cutoff_depth block_size

To Execute the single GPU version:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./a.out size cutoff_depth block_size

There is no visible overhead when the multi-GPU version is used with a single GPU.
